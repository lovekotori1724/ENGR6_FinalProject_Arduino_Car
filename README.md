# ENGR6_FinalProject_Arduino_Car
This is the final project for Mount San Antonio College ENGR6, procedural programming in C.
The primary goal is to create a car using Arduino that can controlled via Bluetooth and has autonomous features.
The specific requirements for this project can be found on the requirements page.
The two autonomous features I chose are line tracking, and crash avoidance.
